# MazeGeneratorPy

---------- FIRST COMMIT ----------

A procedural generation of a maze/labyrinth that uses recursion to find an available path

This program uses a seed, so it IS procedural generation >:(

The spawn room is the one colored in azure and is spawned random in the map (#0AF).

10 boss are spawned in random locations in the grid (the 10 circles that looks like bubbles).

Each room/cell which is generated from the spawn room points to the one that generated it.

Now I'm tired both of programming and writing so I'm going to leave this file this way
Have a good day :)

---------- SECOND COMMIT ----------

I made little improvements, but I am lazy, and I don't want to update the README, if you want
to check out what my code does download python and execute it. 
Bye, your friendly neighbourhood programmer.

P.S.("Neighbourhood" 'cause I used neighbours in my code LOL XD I'm so funny [pls laugh!] )


P.P.S. I got a little help from @danieleborgo
