# MazeGeneratorPy
A procedural generation of a maze/labyrinth that uses recursion to find an available path

This program uses a seed, so it IS procedural generation >:(

The spawn room is the one colored in azure and is spawned random in the map (#0AF)
10 boss are spawned in random locations in the grid (the 10 circles that looks like bubbles)
Each room/cell which is generated from the spawn room points to the one that generated it.
Now I'm tired both of programming and writing so I'm gonna leave this file this way
Have a good day :)
